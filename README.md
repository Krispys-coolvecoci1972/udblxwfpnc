Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder. Honestly, it’s left my brain a bit scrambled. You know when you've been awake too long, fueled only by a questionable third cup of coffee? Yeah, it’s like that. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was like that weird zoo attraction – you think you know what you’re getting, but then, bam, a penguin does a backflip and you're wondering if you're hallucinating from exhaustion.

So, first off, who in their right mind thought of making a   about marching powder? I mean, the title alone had me expecting something different. An army of ants maybe? That would’ve made sense. Haha, I’m tired. Or maybe it’s my inner zoologist screaming for relevance? Anyway, forget the whole “Hollywood polish” nonsense. This was raw. An entire stockpile of emotional stimulations - it had me wincing and laughing, sometimes simultaneously. How does that even work? Kudos to the actors... or maybe a confused sympathy applause? 🤔

> The cinematography, oh lord. Think of when you spill ink on paper and try to clean it up, only to smear it further. Beautifully chaotic. One scene has the protagonist staring into the vast void (still not sure why, maybe metaphorical?), and I just chuckled thinking of my cat staring at the wall for no reason. Maybe the same energy. It was jarring at times, almost demanding your attention like a toddler on a sugar rush.

Pondering about those characters makes me dizzy. There’s that one guy – either the hero or the world’s most tragic comedy relief. His existential crisis moments had the depth of a kiddie pool, yet somehow profound. Like looking at a snow globe and feeling existential dread. You’d have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to understand – maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it, just don’t ask me to explain why you'd want to.

Man, I'm rambling. But you expected that, right? It's what this   does to you. Stir the parts of your brain you didn’t even know had emotions. Oh, and before I forget, here's a handy bit of code which serves absolutely no purpose:

```javascript
function escortCocaineThroughZoo() {
    return 'Don’t ask questions, protagonist just rolled with it';
}
```

There it is. Why? Who even knows. But I’m convinced the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 left that in my brain. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you dare/need a vacation to the absurd. I've got a headache now, like a 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬 just screamed in my ear – and I mean that in the best way possible. Off to sleep this off. Cheers, fellow adventurers in surreal cinema! 😴
